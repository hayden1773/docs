Title: 'SQL'
Description: 'SQL, Structured Query Language, is a programming language designed to manage data stored in these relational databases. SQL operates through simple, declarative statements. This keeps data accurate and secure, and it helps maintain the integrity of databases, regardless of size. We live in a data-informed world, and there are many businesses that store their information inside large, relational databases. This makes SQL a great skill not only for data scientists and engineers, but for anyone wanting to be data-literate.'

SQL, **S**tructured **Q**uery **L**anguage, is a programming language designed to manage data stored in these relational databases. SQL operates through simple, declarative statements. This keeps data accurate and secure, and it helps maintain the integrity of databases, regardless of size.

We live in a data-informed world, and there are many businesses that store their information inside large, relational databases. This makes SQL a great skill not only for data scientists and engineers, but for anyone wanting to be data-literate.

SQL was invented in the 1970s based on the relational data model. It was initially known as the structured English query language (SEQUEL). The term was later shortened to SQL. Oracle, formerly known as Relational Software, became the first vendor to offer a commercial SQL relational database management system.

What is special about SQL?
SQL works by understanding and analyzing data of virtually any size, from small datasets to large stacks. It's a very powerful tool that enables you to perform many functions at high efficiency and speed. The way in which it interacts with databases is 'non-procedural.
